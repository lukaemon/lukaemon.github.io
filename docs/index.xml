<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context">Context</h2>
<p>At first glance, gpt4 is 80% fear and 20% excitement. I’m afraid of its capability, impact to the future of work, and worried about advanced intelligence being controlled by single organization.</p>
<p>However, fear is not real. Danger is. Fear is a mental construct mostly caused by ignorance. In hope to cure the ignorance, I go on studying and using gpt4. After few weeks of processing, the fear subsides. I have better understanding of gpt4’s capability, limitation, risk and the future.</p>
<p>The sheer existence of GPT4 is pivotal to me. It is a wake up call: be prepared to live with AI at all level. I believe GPT4 is pivotal to the society as well. Prepared or not, AI is coming. Open letter<sup>1</sup> like this won’t slow it down, but accelerate. The letter basically validates the hype and few rounds of clickbait journalism and doom hyper would fuel the fear. Leading AI companies would have to handle AI R&amp;D as scientific discovery and political campaign in the post-GPT4 era. AI is political and even more so from now on.</p>

I could be wrong and I am ready to be.</p>

<section id="tldr" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>
<p>My understanding of gpt4 is mostly based on 3 papers and 2 videos. Info per token is so high that requires few rounds of study to fully grasp all nuances from these sources. Here are the most important lesson learned from each. The following article would expand on few points.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="bubeckSparksArtificialGeneral2023">(Bubeck et al. 2023)</span>.
<ul>
<li>Traditional benchmarks are not enough. They fail to capture semantic similarities within statements, and rely primarily on word or sentence-level similarity metrics which capture syntax.</li>
<li>Pure text autoregressive model could learn visual representation and more.</li>
<li>Natural language and code are more controllable than pixels. Symbolic intermediate layer could be useful proxy to high dim modality manipulation. Ex: <code>fn(text) -&gt; image: text -&gt; code -&gt; well controlled skeleton sketch -&gt; super resolution</code>.</li>
<li>CoT is linear decomposition. Useful but not enough. To express loop, recursion and more complex reasoning, multistep modification of scratchpad is helpful. Could use one agent’s context window as scratchpad, aka RAM, and retrieval system as HD. The multi-agent organization to approx system 2 thinking would be an interesting research direction.</li>
<li>The limitations of the next-word prediction paradigm, which manifest as the model’s lack of planning, working memory, ability to backtrack, and reasoning abilities. The model relies on a local and greedy process of generating the next word, without any global or deep understanding of the task or the output.</li>
<li>Current level AI is good at incremental tasks, while human could be good at discontinuous tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>GPT-4 technical report</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="GPT4TechnicalReport">(<span>“<span>GPT-4</span> Technical Report”</span> 2023)</span>.
<ul>
<li>The danger is real. Powerful AI is harder to align.</li>
<li>Threshold crossed. GPT4 is good enough to contribute substantially to self-improvement. GPT3.5 is not as helpful.</li>
<li>RL acts as information bottleneck, which is a form of regulation for better generalization. Apply RL on gpt4 is effective finetuning, contrary to traditional understanding of sample inefficiency due to RL’s sparse feedback. The order to cook intelligence matters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="eloundouGPTsAreGPTs2023">(Eloundou et al. 2023)</span>.
<ul>
<li>Occupation exposure is not important. Jobs would change dramatically in the future. Go first principle to skill level exposure.</li>
<li>Focus resource and time on developing skills that humans have chance to do better than AI. ex: science and critical thinking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fireside Chat with Ilya Sutskever and Jensen Huang: AI Today and Vision of the Future</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="sutskeverFiresideChatIlya2023">(Sutskever and Huang 2023)</span>.
<ul>
<li>Autoregressive model on text is more than statistical token joint distribution. Text is one projection of the world. Learning from text is approximate the world thought a projection, which is essentially learning a world model.</li>
<li>Learning from text is effective but not enough. Multimodal model would be more powerful and sample efficient. Scaling text model is not all you need.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sam Altman: OpenAI CEO on GPT-4, ChatGPT, and the Future of AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #367</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="lexfridmanSamAltmanOpenAI2023">(Lex Fridman 2023)</span>.
<ul>
<li>We learned early on that we need way more capital that won’t be able to raised as non-profit.</li>
<li>We need some benefits of capitalism but not too much. As a non-profit, nothing would happen. As a for-profit, too much would happen.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The following topics are <strong>not important</strong> to <strong>advance the frontier of AI</strong>. Learning to ignore is as useful as learning to pay attention given specific goal. Both are the process of cultivating taste, which is the first pass filter and ultimately decides the direction of change.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SOTA benchmarks. Bar, SAT, GRE, AP test score</strong>: traditional benchmarks are like IQ for human. We all know they are deeply flawed but because these numbers are so relatable, we are not ready to let go. I treat them as quick and dirty AI unit tests and no more. Bar and SAT are great PR creator. Kudos to that.</li>
<li><strong>Training data leak to eval</strong>: getting this right is important to do good science, but don’t waste too much time on this since those benchmarks are not important anymore.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI is not open. Details of architecture, training and data are not published</strong>: I hope they transition to <a href="https://ai.com/">ai.com</a> as soon as possible to close this boring thread. Pure waste of bits.</li>
<li><strong>Whether gpt4 is AGI</strong>: all models are wrong, some could be useful. Intelligence is getting cheaper and cheaper. Risks and promises are closing in. Move on.</li>
<li><strong>Small distilled model on iPhone</strong>: this could be very impactful applied AI, but has nothing to do with the frontier.</li>
</ul>

<section id="breakthrough" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="breakthrough">Breakthrough</h2>
<ul>
<li>GPT4 learns a world model from text.</li>
<li>GPT4 conquers few more bits in the semantics realms to cross the threshold of being useful for self-improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>These breakthroughs fuel the excitement about the possibility of multimodal modal research, and the self-play moment for general AI, similar sentiment of AlphaZero <span class="citation" data-cites="silverMasteringChessShogi2017">(Silver et al. 2017)</span> to Go. Are we already on the artificial intelligence super highway?</p>
<section id="world-model" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="world-model">World model</h3>
<p>To me, gpt4 is as impactful, if not more, as gpt3 <span class="citation" data-cites="brownLanguageModelsAre2020">(Brown et al. 2020)</span>. Before gpt3, people finetune one model per task. To make the finetuning work, data curation (&gt;10k examples), training, deployment <strong>per task</strong> was the norm. GPT3 is a huge gamble. No one bothered training such a large model before. It’s a capital sink that could wreck a small company. Looking backward, the bet pays off very well. 2 lesson learned:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Scaling the same architecture with more data works better.</li>
<li>One LLM could perform many tasks with simple in-context learning.</li>
</ol>
<p>After gpt3, Chinchilla <span class="citation" data-cites="hoffmannTrainingComputeOptimalLarge2022">(Hoffmann et al. 2022)</span>, Gopher <span class="citation" data-cites="raeScalingLanguageModels2022">(Rae et al. 2022)</span>, PaLM <span class="citation" data-cites="chowdheryPaLMScalingLanguage2022">(Chowdhery et al. 2022)</span>, CoT <span class="citation" data-cites="weiChainThoughtPrompting2022">(Wei et al. 2022)</span>, SC <span class="citation" data-cites="wangSelfConsistencyImprovesChain2022a">(Wang et al. 2022)</span> flourished.</p>
<p>The lesson of gpt4, especially how it’s presented in <span class="citation" data-cites="bubeckSparksArtificialGeneral2023">Bubeck et al. (2023)</span>, is text only autoregressive model trained by next token prediction is actually learning a <strong>multimodal world model</strong>. Resonate perfectly with Ilya’s GPT23 talk:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Next token prediction is actually learning some representations of the process that produce the texts, which is a projection of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a shocking revelation to me. I thought language model is just a huge joint distribution function, which happens to mimic some patterns in text. Turns out it’s more than that. Let’s take a look at few examples.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://lukaemon.github.io/posts/2023/apr_1_on-gpt4/unicorn.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>

</div>
<p>Seriously, how does LLM learn what unicorn looks like is still beyond me. Of course there are texts describing unicorns but it has never seen a picture and yet could still draw a better unicorn than me, in TeX?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">

<figcaption class="margin-caption"><span class="citation" data-cites="bubeckSparksArtificialGeneral2023">(Bubeck et al. 2023, fig. 2.1)</span></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is even crazier. Out of uncountable names, gpt4 could recognize this artist name and somehow capture the gist of that artist’s style and use Javascript to render the picture. Speechless.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">

</div>
<p>This one is more than a visual render. It combines the shape of English characters and the idea of the appearance of a person to generate a person, and the generation process is controllable by natural language instructions.</p>
<p>Astute readers would find the generation is secondary, meaning it’s not <code>fn(text) -&gt; pixel</code>, but <code>fn(text) -&gt; code -&gt; pixel</code>. However it’s reasonable to assume gpt4 has the visual idea of the unicorn to generate relevant codes for the render. Plus, a hidden benefit of such secondary generation that could be very useful.</p>
<p>Modern text to image models have trouble following instructions with specific composition. My hunch is text|image joint entropy learned from CLIP, used by latent diffusion<span class="citation" data-cites="rombachHighResolutionImageSynthesis2022">(Rombach et al. 2022)</span> is not fine grained enough to support precise language instruction. For example:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://lukaemon.github.io/posts/2023/apr_1_on-gpt4/mj.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>However, gpt4’s unreasonable effectiveness of text to code could repurpose code as intermediate symbolic layer for fine grained instruction guided image generation.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">

</figure>
</div>
<p>This combines the compositionality of natural language, and the pixel generation of diffusion. Win-win.</p>
<p>Examples above should be enough to reiterate that learning from text is not just about text. If you think about it, texts feed into transformer are sequence of integers, ex: [332, 5242, 12, 24325, …]. We feel so strong on the difference among modalities, such as image, audio, texts, because they are really different semantically to us, humans.</p>
<p>Behind the veil of human semantics, patterns of all modalities are all generated from the same source, this world. Yes text is secondary, interpreted patterns through humans, but it’s powerful and expressive, plus no other modalities to better represent the nuances of human conditions than texts, such that learning from text could actually yield a very useful world model.</p>
<p>The research community is talking about common sense, basic physics and unspoken multimodal knowledge. That’s why text is just the bootstrapping phase not the end of AI. The future has to be multimodal.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="self-improvement-with-rlhf">Self improvement with RLHF</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>…there are benefits to squeezing as much performance as possible out of large generative image models, as significant semantic information may lie in the <code>last few bits</code></p>
<p>–<span class="citation" data-cites="henighanScalingLawsAutoregressive2020">Henighan et al. (2020)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The general improvement of gpt4 over gpt3.5 make self improvement possible. However, we need to pay attention to what could be self-improved, and how.</p>
<p>LLM’s raw capabilities are sealed during pretraining. Ensuing instruction finetuning and RLHF are usability improvement. Imagine a genius who doesn’t know how to talk to normal people. You may think he is dumb and slow but the raw power is there. Say he reads how to win friends and influence people and suddenly, people around him may think his IQ points doubled over a weekend, but no. He is just more accessible after finetuning.</p>
<p>Unlocked self-improvement has 2 folds: self-evaluation, and self-finetuning.<br>
There is no magic in self-evaluation. It’s not gpt4 has gained consciousness and grow the sense of self. GPT4 is stateless. Because it has learned few more bits than gpt3.5, it simple could evaluate whatever text better by following right prompts.</p>
<p>Here I want to use how OpenAI mitigates close domain <strong>hallucination</strong> with <strong>RLHF</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="ouyangTrainingLanguageModels2022">(Ouyang et al. 2022)</span> as an example to illustrate how gpt4 contributes to self-improvement with the power of RL.</p>
<p>Take a look at the example of close and open hallucination.</p>

<p>So on high level: SFT &gt; RM &gt; PPO. I don’t understand why initially. Super confused.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why RL?</li>
<li>If Flan <span class="citation" data-cites="chungScalingInstructionFinetunedLanguage2022">(Chung et al. 2022)</span> is so successful, why not just SFT gpt4 with generated hallucination free data?</li>
<li>Isn’t RL sample inefficient? Cherry on the cake? Sparse feedback makes credit assignment hard, which makes learning even harder? How many unreasonably amount of trials and errors to teach a simple robot in MoJoCo to run?</li>
</ul>
<p>My hypothesis is under the right condition, RL’s disadvantages are actually great for cooking intelligence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good enough base intelligence.</li>
<li>Enough capacity to grow and change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me use human learning as an unscientific example. The goal is to maximize learning, which teacher is more helpful?</p>
<ul>
<li>One that provides extensive explanation, step by step reasoning, even hold your hand during the learning process.</li>
<li>One that only gives you binary feedback such as correct/incorrect, promising/exhausted, right direction/detour.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the appearance, the attentive teacher seems to be the obvious choice, but I realize it depends.</p>
<p>For young Padawan, rich feedbacks and hand holding style is more effective. They need as immersive environment as possible to get over the init stage. They would really struggle with sparse, succinct feedback. Socratic method or Zen style teaching is too early.</p>
<p>On the contrary, for matured enough Jedi to become true master, he has to tackle unknown unknown and generalize mostly by himself. Breaking the frontier can’t by achieved by copy previous success. Overly involved teaching is not helpful, but obstacle that creates a ceiling for the promising Jedi. The guidance could be vague and abstract as long as the direction is good, the student could figure out the details and apply general learnings to other challenges.</p>
<p>Autoregressive model with next token prediction is feedback rich learning. Every token contributes to loss, which signal for the change through back propagation. The process is super parallelizable and optimize that push all high quality text tokens on Earth through the model is doable. Text pretraining is effective intelligence bootstrapping.</p>
<p>After pretraining and essential finetunings, <code>gpt4-early</code> is large enough to take further finetuning without catastrophic forgetting, and intelligent enough to accept high level feedback, aka RLHF.</p>
<p>Even though synthetic data could be used for supervised finetuning, use them to improve reward model to take advantage of RL’s sparse feedback gives you the benefit of information bottleneck, a form of regularization that is even more sample efficient and generalizable. Yoda’s wise or even cryptic words may be confusing and not useful right on, but it points to problems behind a problem, which is more valuable to a smart Jedi looking backward.</p>
<p>Finetuning works better on LLM. RLHF would work better on LLM as well. Small model is not intelligent enough to deal with sparse feedback, and the capacity is too small to endure series of finetuning. GPT4 crosses both the intelligence and capacity threshold to kick start the virtuous self-improvement cycle with RLHF.</p>

<ul>
<li>Multimodal</li>
<li>System 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Firstly, if gpt4 could learn a world model with useful visual representation via such limited text projection, what could be learned from multimodal projection? Visual signals are so innate to humans that some ideas we don’t even bother putting them down in texts. It’s reasonable to assume multimodal learning, if done right, would yield more powerful representation and the learning would be more sample efficient. This is the cutting edge. Even OpenAI downplays the discussion on this topic, but it begs to wonder what if it’s possible to learn a better world model with &lt;20b params and &lt;1T multimodal tokens?</p>
<p>Secondly, the biggest limitation of gpt4 is planning. Current LLM is a stateless function. Autoregressive generation behaves like an iterative recursive process <span class="citation" data-cites="abelsonStructureInterpretationComputer1996">(Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman 1996, fig. 1.4)</span>, keeping states in the argument, aka context window. How to get to system 2? How could long-term memory help? Using tools? Higher level control? Moving beyond next token prediction objective?</p>

<p>Full list of risks from <strong>GPT-4 System Card</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="GPT4TechnicalReport">(<span>“<span>GPT-4</span> Technical Report”</span> 2023)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
<li>Harmful content</li>
<li>Harms of representation, allocation, and quality of service</li>
<li>Disinformation and influence operations</li>
<li>Proliferation of conventional and unconventional weapons</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Cybersecurity</li>
<li>Potential for risky emergent behaviors</li>
<li>Economic impacts</li>
<li>Acceleration</li>
<li>Overreliance</li>
</ul>
<p>Powerful models introduce serious problems. Helpful and harmless are nuanced if not contradictory balance. Even honest is not so trivial. I was not familiar with the full spectrum of risks introduced in the paper because of my ignorance, I mostly focused on capability upgrade like iPhone spec bump. Definitely recommend reading the system card in full to experience the width and depth of AI dark force.</p>
<p>What worries me the most is proliferation and acceleration. The danger of enabling simple minds with unrestricted powerful tools is obvious. Now with AI getting better and taking bigger role of evaluation and self-improvement, the speed of progress may be too fast for human to adapt. Dramatic change is in order. Social unrest is unavoidable. This is steam engine-electricity-internet level of change, even AI stops here with no further improvement.</p>
<p>More and more people are getting at the problem about what value AI should align to, who decides? These are right questions to ask. I hope the process of building ideal AI would force humans to rethink what it means to be a human? What’s the purpose? To what ends? What universal values we should get behind?</p>
<p>There would be Universal Declaration of Human Rights<sup>2</sup> moment in the future that a group of people consciously choose a set of values as foundation of AI of the group. AI would be the most powerful creation of human civilization. I hope we could settle on a set of values that promotes peace, love and autonomy.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights</a></p></div><p>Humans need to learn how to cap the downside and exploit the upside. Alignment research is hot and still underrated. No one wants to live in a world full of super intelligent assholes, to say the least.</p>
<p>For effective collaboration, we need to know who is better at what, and allocating resource accordingly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Incremental tasks: these are tasks which can be solved in a gradual or continuous way, by adding one word or sentence at a time that constitutes progress in the direction of the solution. Those tasks can be solved via content generation which does not require any major conceptual shifts or insights, but rather relies on applying existing knowledge and skills to the given topic or problem. Examples of incremental tasks are writing a summary of a text, answering factual questions, composing a poem based on a given rhyme scheme, or solving a math problem that follows a standard procedure.</li>
<li>Discontinuous tasks: these are tasks where the content generation cannot be done in a gradual or continuous way, but instead requires a certain ”Eureka” idea that accounts for a discontinuous leap in the progress towards the solution of the task. The content generation involves discovering or inventing a new way of looking at or framing the problem, that enables the generation of the rest of the content. Examples of discontinuous tasks are solving a math problem that requires a novel or creative application of a formula, writing a joke or a riddle, coming up with a scientific hypothesis or a philosophical argument, or creating a new genre or style of writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s clear we need to identify and offload incremental work to AI. Cultivate creativity, critical thinking and intuitions that make the leap and connect seemingly irrelevant dots.</p>
<p>Working against AI is futile. Uncontrolled fear is waste of time.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-is-change-mentally-and-physically.-learning-is-creation.">Learning is change, mentally and physically. Learning is creation.</h2>
<p>First, one creates new mental constructs, represented as new neuronal firing patterns. Over time, firing patterns change actual wirings of the brain.</p>
<p>Second, one creates various artifacts to realize learned ideas. Artifacts like poem, book, music, painting, sculpture, architecture, computer program, movie, even video game. The medium is the message. The medium is the host of idea cross pollination cascades. Beautiful and scary ideas are born and died is such infosphere.</p>
<p>Could alway try harder, but time and mental energy can’t be leveraged. Maybe stepping back once for a while to think about how to learn more effectively would be constructive.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</h2>
<p>In the first great SICP<sup>1</sup> course<sup>2</sup>, the professor shares how to learn a new computer language. I believe it applies to all learnings. 3 simple principles are key to manage complexity, experiment and build new things:</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/SICP_cover.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/-J_xL4IGhJA?t=1670">youtube: 2 min</a></p></div><ol type="1">
<li>Primitive elements<br>
</li>
<li>Means of combination<br>
</li>
<li>Means of abstraction</li>
</ol>
<p>Primitive elements are fundamental building block, ex: lego.</p>
<p>Means of combination are API between elements. One could fit different building blocks together for something new. ex: fit variety of lego blocks to build a lego house.</p>
<p>Means of abstraction is where magic happened. How to name a complex construct and use it as primitives in later builds? Building with primitive elements are building from <code>first principle</code>. It offers both maximum flexibility and maximum redundancy. To build a lego city, if one could name a lego house and use it as primitive to expand the lego city, it would be way more efficient than building every single house from scratch.</p>
<p>Mastering primitives, APIs and the power of abstraction, complex system could be understood, and created.</p>

<p>The series do an incredible job to explain the nature of creation from cultural perspective. Artists first would copy lots of previous works to learn the basics and build up muscle memories, primitive elements. Then they could start tweaking old ideas, and fit different ideas together to create new one, means of combination and abstraction.</p>
<p>There would be countless failures during all stages, copy, transform and combine. Typical learning process. One just have to find the grit.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evergreen-notes-and-spaced-repetition">Evergreen notes and spaced repetition</h2>
<p>The idea of evergreen notes<sup>3</sup> is keeping notes on ideas, let them evolve and connect. The process could easily be supported by software such as Obsidian<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C">Andy Matuschak - Evergreen notes</a></p><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<a href="https://obsidian.md/">obsidian.md</a></p></div><p>Think of every idea as primitive. For example, treat the idea about <code>learning to learn</code> as atomic. If one could keep notes about <code>learning to learn</code> whenever it’s triggered and connect it to other ideas, the knowledge graph would become organic. It will function like a mental fusion reactor, reinforcing one idea while making connections to others, even trigger conflicts among ideas. This is super valuable process to sustain. Especially treasure and cultivate the internal conflicts.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bootstrapping-with-delta">Bootstrapping with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta"></h2>
<p>What to copy? To transform? To combine with? I know nothing right now. How to improve the quality of idea?</p>
<p>The quality is conditioned on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How good is the world model?</li>
<li>How goodness of world model attenuate during n step roll out? What’s the largest, usable n?</li>
<li>How fast, how many orthogonal possibilities could be found based on n-step rolled out simulations?</li>
<li>Precision and recall?
<ul>
<li>Precision: the ratio of good idea.</li>
<li>Recall: out of all good possible ideas, how many are found?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Generate 100 bad ideas to get a good one is ok at the beginning, but sticking to naive working hard is never ideal. To improve, one needs to improve the world model, the quality of simulation and the efficiency of exploration.</p>
<p>Great mentors and brilliant peers are a bliss. However, solo walker could still make meaningful strides. <strong>The key is to expand on time axis and create <code>delta</code> to answer known unknown and explore unknown unknown.</strong></p>
<p>Learning by doing is effective to create <code>delta</code>. One should adapt read-do-read-do cycle, instead of read-read-read-do. Creating delta is similar to debugging computer program. Create breakpoints, log tiered info, analyze log, error message and abnormal behavior.</p>
<p>Starting every new project by writing down the context and expectation. The goal is to create a <code>t_0</code> snapshot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger of the project? Why?</li>
<li>Expected result?</li>
<li>Expected learning?</li>
<li>Expected obstacles?</li>
</ul>
<p>During the project, create an operational log. The goal is to create <code>range(t_1, t_n)</code> snapshots.</p>
<ul>
<li>Log new ideas about how to improve the project, possible extension, connection to other projects, follow up, even tangential quantum leap. Don’t care about the quality. Just log.</li>
<li>Log questions. One should have many questions, confusions pop out during the project. Log them all.</li>
<li>Log tentative realizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole project is an intensive self-question-answering process. Like be your own psychiatrist to debug your own mind. One should generate result and an operational log as side effects. Finish the project and critique snapshots.</p>
<p>Critique of the context is the largest <code>delta</code>. One may enter the project for all the wrong reasons and with many biased or varied expectations. Hopefully one could recognize some and figure out why looking backward.</p>
<p>Critique of logs creates a flow of <code>delta</code> along the progress. Hopefully one could see how old perspective changes and new form. One could ask old questions sharper, and start asking new questions.</p>
<p>That <code>delta</code> is THE force. Actively search, mine, recognize, accept and adopt to it.</p>
<p>Learning is a process of resolving merge conflicts between internal world model and perceived reality. Faster learning means one is willing to and could resolve more conflicts in a shorter time. Stopped learning means one is unwilling to or unable to see the delta and resolve the conflict.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping is soliloquy by nature. Endless self-play. It could be a long gradually with no light of suddenly, but one can choose to believe.</p>
<p>For most adults, multiagent learning is more humane. However, if one could effectively copy, transform and simulate different perspectives through various media such as papers or books, some of real human apprenticeship or peers could be replaced by self-multiagent learning, ideally saving communication overhead and redundant information. This is similar to self-ensemble on LLM conditioned by different prompts.</p>
<p>It’s possible to be your own mentor, simulate the diversified peers and grow sustainably. Just have to reset and self-question all the time to keep many characters alive in one brain. Not the most effective route though. One will learn way more faster by simply observing brilliant people. Deep collaboration has even greater yields. Closed mode can’t match such electrifying environment, but slow learning is real, honest and grounded.</p>
</section>
<section id="why" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why">Why</h2>
<p>These ideas are in the same league of every other how to knowledge, means to ends. Humans build tools to achieve goals. However, developing the understanding of how is as important as the understanding of why.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.</p>
<p>– <cite>Friedrich Nietzsche</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy learning and remember to ask periodically: <code>to what ends?</code></p>

<p>Humor is preconditioned on the ability to see the bright side of something. One has to be able to see many sides, consciously choose the funny, optimistic interpretation and express in a way that resonates with target audiences. It shows both raw intelligence and wisdom.</p>
<p>To detect humor and be humorous, grounding is necessary. Grounding to me is weaving modalities. Just a fancy way of saying having sampled variety of experiences of certain things or events.</p>
<p>For example, to know what it really means about apple, one could write “apple”, read about it, draw, hold, throw, smell, eat, plant, cook, even share it with others. Without grounding, one can’t have acute and diversified perspectives on a thing or an event. It would be very hard to see ironic yet optimistic interpretation, be it human or AI.</p>
<p>Grounding AI to full set of human experience is aligning computational humor to humans’. They may be able to see a kind of digital humor that is a bridge too far for us. Literally why Samantha in Her leaving Theodore<sup>1</sup>.</p>

I see this as the source of Yann’s recent debate with others<sup>2</sup>. It’s the most difficult test to pass. It’s the most difficult test to create.</p>
