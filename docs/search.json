Were all these vast designs and rapid strides worth it? Thoreau thought not. He came to this truth: “They are but improved means to an unimproved end.”And still the trains chugged along, and the factories hummed, and the banks opened and closed, and the presses printed newspapers, and the telegraph wires reached across the nation, in one great and unending thrum.\n– Jill Lepore, These Truths: A History of the United States\n\nI’m having fun grokking AI."

    "text": "MJ: abstract art, picasso’s expression about humor –ar 16:9\n\n\nHumor is preconditioned on the ability to see the bright side of something. One has to be able to see many sides, consciously choose the funny, optimistic interpretation and express in a way that resonates with target audiences. It shows both raw intelligence and wisdom.\nTo detect humor and be humorous, grounding is necessary. Grounding to me is weaving modalities. Just a fancy way of saying having sampled variety of experiences of certain things or events.\nFor example, to know what it really means about apple, one could write “apple”, read about it, draw, hold, throw, smell, eat, plant, cook, even share it with others. Without grounding, one can’t have acute and diversified perspectives on a thing or an event. It would be very hard to see ironic yet optimistic interpretation, be it human or AI.\nGrounding AI to full set of human experience is aligning computational humor to humans’. They may be able to see a kind of digital humor that is a bridge too far for us. Literally why Samantha in Her leaving Theodore1.\n1 youtube2 tweetHumor is the ultimate Turing test. I see this as the source of Yann’s recent debate with others2. It’s the most difficult test to pass. It’s the most difficult test to create.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{shen2023,\n  author = {Shen, Lucas},\n  title = {Humor {AI}},\n  date = {2023-02-05},\n  url = {https://lukaemon.github.io/posts/2023/feb_5_humor-ai},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nShen, Lucas. 2023. “Humor AI.” February 5, 2023. https://lukaemon.github.io/posts/2023/feb_5_humor-ai."

    "text": "Learning is change, mentally and physically. Learning is creation.\nFirst, one creates new mental constructs, represented as new neuronal firing patterns. Over time, firing patterns change actual wirings of the brain.\nSecond, one creates various artifacts to realize learned ideas. Artifacts like poem, book, music, painting, sculpture, architecture, computer program, movie, even video game. The medium is the message. The medium is the host of idea cross pollination cascades. Beautiful and scary ideas are born and died is such infosphere.\nCould alway try harder, but time and mental energy can’t be leveraged. Maybe stepping back once for a while to think about how to learn more effectively would be constructive."

One could fit different building blocks together for something new. ex: fit variety of lego blocks to build a lego house.\nMeans of abstraction is where magic happened. How to name a complex construct and use it as primitives in later builds? Building with primitive elements are building from first principle. It offers both maximum flexibility and maximum redundancy. To build a lego city, if one could name a lego house and use it as primitive to expand the lego city, it would be way more efficient than building every single house from scratch.\nMastering primitives, APIs and the power of abstraction, complex system could be understood, and created."

Artists first would copy lots of previous works to learn the basics and build up muscle memories, primitive elements. Then they could start tweaking old ideas, and fit different ideas together to create new one, means of combination and abstraction.\nThere would be countless failures during all stages, copy, transform and combine. Typical learning process. One just have to find the grit."

The process could easily be supported by software such as Obsidian4.\n3 Andy Matuschak - Evergreen notes4 obsidian.mdThink of every idea as primitive. For example, treat the idea about learning to learn as atomic. If one could keep notes about learning to learn whenever it’s triggered and connect it to other ideas, the knowledge graph would become organic. It will function like a mental fusion reactor, reinforcing one idea while making connections to others, even trigger conflicts among ideas. This is super valuable process to sustain. Especially treasure and cultivate the internal conflicts.\n\nThe test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald\n\nSpaced repetition5 resonates well with understanding primitives and the copy phase. Find the rhythm to reinforce fundamentals and grow the network density.\n5 Andy Matuschak - How can we develop transformative tools for thought?6 wikiIt could be unintentional repetition or deliberate practice6.

    "text": "Bootstrapping with \\(\\Delta\\)\nWhat to copy? To transform? To combine with? I know nothing right now. How to improve the quality of idea?\nThe quality is conditioned on:\n\nHow good is the world model?\nHow goodness of world model attenuate during n step roll out? What’s the largest, usable n?\nHow fast, how many orthogonal possibilities could be found based on n-step rolled out simulations?\nPrecision and recall?\n\nPrecision: the ratio of good idea.\nRecall: out of all good possible ideas, how many are found?\n\n\nGenerate 100 bad ideas to get a good one is ok at the beginning, but sticking to naive working hard is never ideal. To improve, one needs to improve the world model, the quality of simulation and the efficiency of exploration.\nGreat mentors and brilliant peers are a bliss. However, solo walker could still make meaningful strides. The key is to expand on time axis and create delta to answer known unknown and explore unknown unknown.\nLearning by doing is effective to create delta. One should adapt read-do-read-do cycle, instead of read-read-read-do. Creating delta is similar to debugging computer program. Create breakpoints, log tiered info, analyze log, error message and abnormal behavior.\nStarting every new project by writing down the context and expectation. The goal is to create a t_0 snapshot.\n\nTrigger of the project? Why?\nExpected result?\nExpected learning?\nExpected obstacles?\n\nDuring the project, create an operational log. The goal is to create range(t_1, t_n) snapshots.\n\nLog new ideas about how to improve the project, possible extension, connection to other projects, follow up, even tangential quantum leap. Don’t care about the quality. Just log.\nLog questions. One should have many questions, confusions pop out during the project. Log them all.\nLog tentative realizations.\n\nThe whole project is an intensive self-question-answering process. Like be your own psychiatrist to debug your own mind. One should generate result and an operational log as side effects. Finish the project and critique snapshots.\nCritique of the context is the largest delta. One may enter the project for all the wrong reasons and with many biased or varied expectations. Hopefully one could recognize some and figure out why looking backward.\nCritique of logs creates a flow of delta along the progress. Hopefully one could see how old perspective changes and new form. One could ask old questions sharper, and start asking new questions.\nThat delta is THE force. Actively search, mine, recognize, accept and adopt to it.\nLearning is a process of resolving merge conflicts between internal world model and perceived reality. Faster learning means one is willing to and could resolve more conflicts in a shorter time. Stopped learning means one is unwilling to or unable to see the delta and resolve the conflict.\nBootstrapping is soliloquy by nature. Endless self-play. It could be a long gradually with no light of suddenly, but one can choose to believe.\nFor most adults, multiagent learning is more humane. However, if one could effectively copy, transform and simulate different perspectives through various media such as papers or books, some of real human apprenticeship or peers could be replaced by self-multiagent learning, ideally saving communication overhead and redundant information. This is similar to self-ensemble on LLM conditioned by different prompts.\nIt’s possible to be your own mentor, simulate the diversified peers and grow sustainably. Just have to reset and self-question all the time to keep many characters alive in one brain. Not the most effective route though. One will learn way more faster by simply observing brilliant people. Deep collaboration has even greater yields. Closed mode can’t match such electrifying environment, but slow learning is real, honest and grounded."
