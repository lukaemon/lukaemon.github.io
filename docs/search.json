How to improve the quality of idea?\nThe quality is conditioned on:\n\nHow good is the world model?\nHow goodness of world model attenuate during n step roll out? What’s the largest, usable n?\nHow fast, how many orthogonal possibilities could be found based on n-step rolled out simulations?\nPrecision and recall?\n\nPrecision: the ratio of good idea.\nRecall: out of all good possible ideas, how many are found?\n\n\nGenerate 100 bad ideas to get a good one is ok at the beginning, but sticking to naive working hard is never ideal. To improve, one needs to improve the world model, the quality of simulation and the efficiency of exploration.\nGreat mentors and brilliant peers are a bliss. However, solo walker could still make meaningful strides. The key is to expand on time axis and create delta to answer known unknown and explore unknown unknown.\nLearning by doing is effective to create delta. One should adapt read-do-read-do cycle, instead of read-read-read-do. Creating delta is similar to debugging computer program. Create breakpoints, log tiered info, analyze log, error message and abnormal behavior.\nStarting every new project by writing down the context and expectation. The goal is to create a t_0 snapshot.\n\nTrigger of the project? Why?\nExpected result?\nExpected learning?\nExpected obstacles?\n\nDuring the project, create an operational log. The goal is to create range(t_1, t_n) snapshots.\n\nLog new ideas about how to improve the project, possible extension, connection to other projects, follow up, even tangential quantum leap. Don’t care about the quality. Just log.\nLog questions. One should have many questions, confusions pop out during the project. Log them all.\nLog tentative realizations.\n\nThe whole project is an intensive self-question-answering process. Like be your own psychiatrist to debug your own mind. One should generate result and an operational log as side effects. Finish the project and critique snapshots.\nCritique of the context is the largest delta. One may enter the project for all the wrong reasons and with many biased or varied expectations. Hopefully one could recognize some and figure out why looking backward.\nCritique of logs creates a flow of delta along the progress. Hopefully one could see how old perspective changes and new form. One could ask old questions sharper, and start asking new questions.\nThat delta is THE force. Actively search, mine, recognize, accept and adopt to it.\nLearning is a process of resolving merge conflicts between internal world model and perceived reality. Faster learning means one is willing to and could resolve more conflicts in a shorter time. Stopped learning means one is unwilling to or unable to see the delta and resolve the conflict.\nBootstrapping is soliloquy by nature. Endless self-play. It could be a long gradually with no light of suddenly, but one can choose to believe.\nFor most adults, multiagent learning is more humane. However, if one could effectively copy, transform and simulate different perspectives through various media such as papers or books, some of real human apprenticeship or peers could be replaced by self-multiagent learning, ideally saving communication overhead and redundant information. This is similar to self-ensemble on LLM conditioned by different prompts.\nIt’s possible to be your own mentor, simulate the diversified peers and grow sustainably. Just have to reset and self-question all the time to keep many characters alive in one brain. Not the most effective route though. One will learn way more faster by simply observing brilliant people. Deep collaboration has even greater yields. Closed mode can’t match such electrifying environment, but slow learning is real, honest and grounded."

One has to be able to see many sides, consciously choose the funny, optimistic interpretation and express in a way that resonates with target audiences. It shows both raw intelligence and wisdom.\nTo detect humor and be humorous, grounding is necessary. Grounding to me is weaving modalities. Just a fancy way of saying having sampled variety of experiences of certain things or events.\nFor example, to know what it really means about apple, one could write “apple”, read about it, draw, hold, throw, smell, eat, plant, cook, even share it with others. Without grounding, one can’t have acute and diversified perspectives on a thing or an event. It would be very hard to see ironic yet optimistic interpretation, be it human or AI.\nGrounding AI to full set of human experience is aligning computational humor to humans’. They may be able to see a kind of digital humor that is a bridge too far for us. Literally why Samantha in Her leaving Theodore1.1 youtube\nHumor is the ultimate Turing test.

    "text": "Attention bottleneck\nInspired by this great presentation1 from Jack Rae, I realize that different form of bottleneck, ex: global workspace theory (Baars 2017), could be interpreted as different expression of Occam’s razor, which has deep root in information theory that regards effective compression as general intelligence.1 Compression for AGI - Jack Rae\nCopy and paste is just brute force. Information bottleneck is suffering that builds intelligence.\nNagrani et al. (2022) introduces bottleneck mid fusion. I see it as successor to Gato’s (Reed et al. 2022) all you can eat style early fusion. This is a beautiful implementation of using bottleneck to foster learning intelligence.\n\n\n\nNagrani et al. (2022)\n\n\nThe beauty of bottleneck mid fusion comes from few realizations about multimodal learning:\n\n\nvariations in learning dynamics between modalities\ndifferent noise topologies, with some modality streams containing more information for the task at hand than others\nspecialized input representations.\n\n–Nagrani et al. (2022)\n\nResonate pretty well with Rombach et al. (2022)\n\nMost bits of a digital image correspond to imperceptible details. While DMs allow to suppress this semantically meaningless information by minimizing the responsible loss term, gradients (during training) and the neural network backbone (training and inference) still need to be evaluated on all pixels, leading to superfluous computations and unnecessarily expensive optimization and inference. We propose latent diffusion models (LDMs) as an effective generative model and a separate mild compression stage that only eliminates imperceptible details.\n\nYou can see that noise topology exemplified with image. Bits are not equal to information, and human civilization builds semantics only on the subset of all information. Multimodal learning has to deal with different noise topology among different modalities. That’s why early fusion could work, but it would be far from Pareto frontier.\nbottleneck mid fusion is making Pareto improvement by doing mid fusion with information bottleneck. Mid fusion affords different modality independent computation to weed out noises. The context window of bottleneck token is global workspace, on which joint representation could be learned. The hope is quality of joint representation could be foster by imposed limitation.\nWith basic understandings about the baseline and cutting edge, moving on to juxtaposition."

    "text": "Text: 2017 OG encoder-decoder > hyperscaled decoder\nText2text treat input text as a modality. Info of input text is fused to text generative model to decide what to generate next. Encoder decoder architecture is basically a forced sparsity that implements a form of mid fusion and information bottleneck.\nThe whole encoder stack is isolated representation learning of input text. Regardless how many input tokens, as long as they are within context window, the output is a learned representation, a vector in latent space. Text to vector is a huge bottleneck. Useful information are encoded in the topological relationships in such latent space.\nFor example, the T5 model takes input text and transforms it into a learned representation for the decoder stack. This transformation involves mapping a (number_of_token, d_model) tensor to a (d_model) tensor where d_model is 768 according to the model’s configuration2. The input goes through several transformer layers before producing this vector.2 config.json\nThe model’s bottleneck is in the encoder stack, where the input text is transformed into a 768-dimensional latent space. Each input text is represented as a unique vector in this space, and the model’s intelligence depends on the relationships between these vectors, particularly for input texts that the model has not seen before.\nRepresentation is later used in cross-attention to contribute relevant information to the text generation stack. The relevancy is conditioned on generated text and the relevant info added to the output of masked attention\n\nAll modular computation functions can be reduced to function composition: the output of the function \\(f_{\\theta_i}\\) of a model is added to a new term that depends on a learned function \\(f_{\\varphi}\\): \\(f'_i(x) = f_{\\theta}(x) + f_{\\varphi_i}(x)\\).\n–Pfeiffer et al. (2023)\n\nYou can see masked attention + cross attention is that addition. The purpose of the whole encoder stack and cross attention is to infuse input info to change how text generative function works. This is what adapters do.\nWhy don’t we have 100b+ T5, but many 100b+ decoder only LLM?\nText only modality doesn’t deal with different noise topology. It has one learning dynamics with coherent input representation. Forced mid fusion is unnecessary engineering. That’s why independent encoder is redundant especially during the push of hyperscaling to squeeze out the last few bits.\n\n…there are benefits to squeezing as much performance as possible out of large generative image models, as significant semantic information may lie in the last few bits\n–Henighan et al. (2020)\n\nSmall model (<20b) is not as powerful as 100b+ model. Forced sparsity could be useful inductive bias to boost performance to a point. That’s why T5 works great for finetuning (Wang et al. 2022; Longpre et al. 2023). It’s meant to be specialized. However, when the goal is foundation model that saturates one modality as much as possible, scale is one working formula and the raw performance is self-evident. Big models are more sample efficient, learn faster and compress better.\n\n\n\nTouvron et al. (2023)"

You need to find a balance and curb the long input outlier.\nFor this dataset, 1153 max is not too crazy.\n\nPadding experiments\nLet’s experiment with different padding strategy and how it affects the following batching and training.\nFirst, do it without truncation:\n\ntk_dialogue = tokenizer(ds[\"train\"][\"dialogue\"], padding=True)[\"input_ids\"]\ntk_summary = tokenizer(ds[\"train\"][\"summary\"], padding=True)[\"input_ids\"]\npd.set_option('display.float_format', lambda x: '%.1f' % x)\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\"dialogue\": [len(d) for d in tk_dialogue], \"summary\": [len(s) for s in tk_summary]}\n)\nprint(df.describe())\n\n       dialogue  summary\ncount   14732.0  14732.0\nmean     1153.0     94.0\nstd         0.0      0.0\nmin      1153.0     94.0\n25%      1153.0     94.0\n50%      1153.0     94.0\n75%      1153.0     94.0\nmax      1153.0     94.0\n\n\nExpected result. This is literally treating the whole training corpus as one full batch. All sequences are pad to the max length, 1153.\nTry this idea with batch_size = 8 in dataloader.\n\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\n\ncollator = DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer, padding=True)\ndl = DataLoader(ds['train'].with_transform(lambda x: tokenizer(x['dialogue'])), batch_size=8, collate_fn=collator)\n\n\ntk_batched = np.array([batch['input_ids'].shape[-1] for batch in dl])\n\nprint(len(tk_batched), len(dl))\nprint(len(np.unique(tk_batched)))\n\nnp.unique(tk_batched).max(), np.unique(tk_batched).mean(), np.unique(tk_batched).min()b\n\n1842 1842\n482\n\n\n(1153, 389.02904564315355, 92)\n\n\n1842 batches, with 482 unique length. This is fine for pytorch but would be brutal for jax jit since every change of input shape would trigger jit recompilation.\n\nIf training on TPU, it is recommended to pad all examples of the dataset to the same length or make use of pad_to_multiple_of to have a small number of predefined bucket sizes to fit all examples in. Dynamically padding batches to the longest example is not recommended on TPU as it triggers a recompilation for every batch shape that is encountered during training thus significantly slowing down the training. only padding up to the longest example in a batch) leads to very slow training on TPU.\n\nThe part of only padding to the longest leads to slow training applies to pytorch as well.\nTry pad_to_multiple_of=8 to curb the variance of token length in batches.\n\ncollator = DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer, padding=True, pad_to_multiple_of=8)\ndl = DataLoader(ds['train'].with_transform(lambda x: tokenizer(x['dialogue'])), batch_size=8, collate_fn=collator)\n\n\ntk_batched = np.array([batch['input_ids'].shape[-1] for batch in dl])\n\nprint(len(tk_batched), len(dl))\nprint(len(np.unique(tk_batched)))\n\nnp.unique(tk_batched).max(), np.unique(tk_batched).mean(), np.unique(tk_batched).min()\n\n1842 1842\n91\n\n\n(1160, 485.27472527472526, 96)\n\n\n1842 batches with 91 unique lengths, much better.\n\n\nTruncation experiment\nHow does truncation=True change anything? According to huggingface doc: tokenizer(batch_sentences, padding=True, truncation=True) has the same effect as tokenizer(batch_sentences, padding=True), both padding to max sequence in batch.\nLet’s try it out.\n\ncollator = DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer, padding=True, pad_to_multiple_of=8)\ndl = DataLoader(ds['train'].with_transform(lambda x: tokenizer(x['dialogue'], truncation=True)), batch_size=8, collate_fn=collator)\n\n\ntk_batched = np.array([batch['input_ids'].shape[-1] for batch in dl])\n\nprint(len(tk_batched), len(dl))\nprint(len(np.unique(tk_batched)))\n\nnp.unique(tk_batched).max(), np.unique(tk_batched).mean(), np.unique(tk_batched).min()\n\n1842 1842\n51\n\n\n(512, 311.52941176470586, 96)\n\n\ntruncation=True in the tokenizer truncates the dialogue to 512 tokens, which is the max length of the T5. However, by default T5 should not have a set maximum length. This is imposed, artificial limitation by transformers library.\nBe careful to this behavior. Since unnoticed truncation means unnoticed loss input information during training.\n\n\nSource implementation\nIn source ipynb:\ntokenized_inputs = concatenate_datasets([dataset[\"train\"], dataset[\"test\"]]).map(lambda x: tokenizer(x[\"dialogue\"], truncation=True), batched=True, remove_columns=[\"dialogue\", \"summary\"])\nmax_source_length = max([len(x) for x in tokenized_inputs[\"input_ids\"]])\n\ndef preprocess_function(sample,padding=\"max_length\"):\n    # add prefix to the input for t5\n    inputs = [\"summarize: \" + item for item in sample[\"dialogue\"]]\n\n    # tokenize inputs\n    model_inputs = tokenizer(inputs, max_length=max_source_length, padding=padding, truncation=True)\n    pass\n\nIt pads every input to absolute corpus max length. Would waste tons of memory and computation. The mean of dialogue is 149, meaning on average, 1k unnecessary tokens would be processed for each instance, and we have 14732 instances in training set.\nI use flan-t5 which is the heir of LM adopted T5, that makes prepending summarize: to the input not necessary."

Our results suggest that for certain flavours of mathematical or logical reasoning tasks, it is unlikely that scale alone will lead to performance breakthroughs. –(Rae et al. 2022)\n\nIt points out flat scaling curve of few task categories. Since then, google has been very creative to push the frontier with CoT (Wei et al. 2022), SC (Wang et al. 2022) and least to most (Zhou et al. 2022). CoT is the most exciting method to scale computation on tasks since few-shot in-context learning.\nInformal reasoning would be solved. DeepMind and OpenAI are all into solving formal reasoning, the last frontier wrt reasoning if AI could get logic and math right.\nCodex family model is the first step on solving formal reasoning. In SC and BBH (Suzgun et al. 2022), code-davinci-002 performs better than InstructGPT families on reasoning tasks. DeepMind even dives into GNN to explore architecture other than transformer. Reasoning in general would be solved as a modality in near future. It may require a specialized model, but would ultimately be fused into general LLM like image, audio and the like.\n\nThe approach to the irreducible loss does not necessarily indicate diminishing returns for representation quality or semantic content as significant semantic information may lie in the last few bits. –(Henighan et al. 2020)\n\nTo get natural language understanding right, scale is necessary. This also explains why CoT only works with scale. Small model makes too many semantic mistakes that render scaling computation with CoT worthless. SC could cancel out mistakes by majority vote to improve performance for model of all size but the increased computational cost far out weight possible gain for small model. Self-ensemble weak reasoner is a waste of resource."

That’s why retrieval is necessary. One could treat external knowledge database as one modality and figure out how to fuse it with general LLM.\nThink about how existing multimodal model fuses modalities, ex: Dall-E (Ramesh et al. 2022), Diffusion (Rombach et al. 2022), MusicLM (Agostinelli et al. 2023). RETRO (Borgeaud et al. 2022) is a great example of treating external memory as modality and fuse it with general LM deeply. Of course it’s not plug and play but still a very interesting direction.\nIn-context retrieval dominates current research output because of light resource requirement. Its value is similar to prompt engineering: the most effective method to probe LLM to find new gains, but prompt engineering would never be the ultimate solution. It’s a tentative exploration process. Like instruction finetuning makes LLM to follow human instruction and do CoT in 0 shot, rather than few shot, RETRO like solution may render methods such as recitaiton (Sun et al. 2022) unnecessary. However, recitation to me is like SC for open ended text generation, which is one great first step into retrieval world by scaling computation on retrieval tasks, like CoT to rationale engineering."

    "text": "tl;dr\nMy understanding of gpt4 is mostly based on 3 papers and 2 videos. Info per token is so high that requires few rounds of study to fully grasp all nuances from these sources. Here are the most important lesson learned from each. The following article would expand on few points.\n\nSparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4 (Bubeck et al. 2023).\n\nTraditional benchmarks are not enough. They fail to capture semantic similarities within statements, and rely primarily on word or sentence-level similarity metrics which capture syntax.\nPure text autoregressive model could learn visual representation and more.\nNatural language and code are more controllable than pixels. Symbolic intermediate layer could be useful proxy to high dim modality manipulation. Ex: fn(text) -> image: text -> code -> well controlled skeleton sketch -> super resolution.\nCoT is linear decomposition. Useful but not enough. To express loop, recursion and more complex reasoning, multistep modification of scratchpad is helpful. Could use one agent’s context window as scratchpad, aka RAM, and retrieval system as HD. The multi-agent organization to approx system 2 thinking would be an interesting research direction.\nThe limitations of the next-word prediction paradigm, which manifest as the model’s lack of planning, working memory, ability to backtrack, and reasoning abilities. The model relies on a local and greedy process of generating the next word, without any global or deep understanding of the task or the output.\nCurrent level AI is good at incremental tasks, while human could be good at discontinuous tasks.\n\nGPT-4 technical report (“GPT-4 Technical Report” 2023).\n\nThe danger is real. Powerful AI is harder to align.\nThreshold crossed. GPT4 is good enough to contribute substantially to self-improvement. GPT3.5 is not as helpful.\nRL acts as information bottleneck, which is a form of regulation for better generalization. Apply RL on gpt4 is effective finetuning, contrary to traditional understanding of sample inefficiency due to RL’s sparse feedback. The order to cook intelligence matters.\n\nGPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models (Eloundou et al. 2023).\n\nOccupation exposure is not important. Jobs would change dramatically in the future. Go first principle to skill level exposure.\nFocus resource and time on developing skills that humans have chance to do better than AI. ex: science and critical thinking.\n\nFireside Chat with Ilya Sutskever and Jensen Huang: AI Today and Vision of the Future (Sutskever and Huang 2023).\n\nAutoregressive model on text is more than statistical token joint distribution. Text is one projection of the world. Learning from text is approximate the world thought a projection, which is essentially learning a world model.\nLearning from text is effective but not enough. Multimodal model would be more powerful and sample efficient. Scaling text model is not all you need.\n\nSam Altman: OpenAI CEO on GPT-4, ChatGPT, and the Future of AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #367 (Lex Fridman 2023).\n\nWe learned early on that we need way more capital that won’t be able to raised as non-profit.\nWe need some benefits of capitalism but not too much. As a non-profit, nothing would happen. As a for-profit, too much would happen.\n\n\nThe following topics are not important to advance the frontier of AI. Learning to ignore is as useful as learning to pay attention given specific goal. Both are the process of cultivating taste, which is the first pass filter and ultimately decides the direction of change.\n\nSOTA benchmarks. Bar, SAT, GRE, AP test score: traditional benchmarks are like IQ for human. We all know they are deeply flawed but because these numbers are so relatable, we are not ready to let go. I treat them as quick and dirty AI unit tests and no more. Bar and SAT are great PR creator. Kudos to that.\nTraining data leak to eval: getting this right is important to do good science, but don’t waste too much time on this since those benchmarks are not important anymore.\nOpenAI is not open. Details of architecture, training and data are not published: I hope they transition to ai.com as soon as possible to close this boring thread. Pure waste of bits.\nWhether gpt4 is AGI: all models are wrong, some could be useful. Intelligence is getting cheaper and cheaper. Risks and promises are closing in. Move on.\nSmall distilled model on iPhone: this could be very impactful applied AI, but has nothing to do with the frontier."

    "text": "Breakthrough\n\nGPT4 learns a world model from text.\nGPT4 conquers few more bits in the semantics realms to cross the threshold of being useful for self-improvement.\n\nThese breakthroughs fuel the excitement about the possibility of multimodal modal research, and the self-play moment for general AI, similar sentiment of AlphaZero (Silver et al. 2017) to Go. Are we already on the artificial intelligence super highway?\n\nWorld model\nTo me, gpt4 is as impactful, if not more, as gpt3 (Brown et al. 2020). Before gpt3, people finetune one model per task. To make the finetuning work, data curation (>10k examples), training, deployment per task was the norm. GPT3 is a huge gamble. No one bothered training such a large model before. It’s a capital sink that could wreck a small company. Looking backward, the bet pays off very well. 2 lesson learned:\n\nScaling the same architecture with more data works better.\nOne LLM could perform many tasks with simple in-context learning.\n\nAfter gpt3, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al. 2022), Gopher (Rae et al. 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al. 2022), CoT (Wei et al. 2022), SC (Wang et al. 2022) flourished.\nThe lesson of gpt4, especially how it’s presented in Bubeck et al. (2023), is text only autoregressive model trained by next token prediction is actually learning a multimodal world model. Resonate perfectly with Ilya’s GPT23 talk:\n\nNext token prediction is actually learning some representations of the process that produce the texts, which is a projection of the world.\n\nThis is a shocking revelation to me. I thought language model is just a huge joint distribution function, which happens to mimic some patterns in text. Turns out it’s more than that. Let’s take a look at few examples.\n\n\n\n(Bubeck et al. 2023, fig. 1.3)\n\n\nSeriously, how does LLM learn what unicorn looks like is still beyond me. Of course there are texts describing unicorns but it has never seen a picture and yet could still draw a better unicorn than me, in TeX?\n\n\n\n(Bubeck et al. 2023, fig. 2.1)\n\n\nThis is even crazier. Out of uncountable names, gpt4 could recognize this artist name and somehow capture the gist of that artist’s style and use Javascript to render the picture. Speechless.\n\n\n\n(Bubeck et al. 2023, fig. 2.5)\n\n\nThis one is more than a visual render. It combines the shape of English characters and the idea of the appearance of a person to generate a person, and the generation process is controllable by natural language instructions.\nAstute readers would find the generation is secondary, meaning it’s not fn(text) -> pixel, but fn(text) -> code -> pixel. However it’s reasonable to assume gpt4 has the visual idea of the unicorn to generate relevant codes for the render. Plus, a hidden benefit of such secondary generation that could be very useful.\nModern text to image models have trouble following instructions with specific composition. My hunch is text|image joint entropy learned from CLIP, used by latent diffusion(Rombach et al. 2022) is not fine grained enough to support precise language instruction. For example:\n\n\n\nMidJourney: three people in a row, one man in mid 40s on the left wearing a suit, holding an iphone, a yound lady in the middle, and a 6 year old boy wearing school uniform on the right. –ar 3:2\n\n\nHowever, gpt4’s unreasonable effectiveness of text to code could repurpose code as intermediate symbolic layer for fine grained instruction guided image generation.\n\n\n\n(Bubeck et al. 2023, fig. 2.8)\n\n\nThis combines the compositionality of natural language, and the pixel generation of diffusion. Win-win.\nExamples above should be enough to reiterate that learning from text is not just about text. If you think about it, texts feed into transformer are sequence of integers, ex: [332, 5242, 12, 24325, …]. We feel so strong on the difference among modalities, such as image, audio, texts, because they are really different semantically to us, humans.\nBehind the veil of human semantics, patterns of all modalities are all generated from the same source, this world. Yes text is secondary, interpreted patterns through humans, but it’s powerful and expressive, plus no other modalities to better represent the nuances of human conditions than texts, such that learning from text could actually yield a very useful world model.\nThe research community is talking about common sense, basic physics and unspoken multimodal knowledge. That’s why text is just the bootstrapping phase not the end of AI. The future has to be multimodal.\n\n\nSelf improvement with RLHF\n\n…there are benefits to squeezing as much performance as possible out of large generative image models, as significant semantic information may lie in the last few bits\n–Henighan et al. (2020)\n\nThe general improvement of gpt4 over gpt3.5 make self improvement possible. However, we need to pay attention to what could be self-improved, and how.\nLLM’s raw capabilities are sealed during pretraining. Ensuing instruction finetuning and RLHF are usability improvement. Imagine a genius who doesn’t know how to talk to normal people. You may think he is dumb and slow but the raw power is there. Say he reads how to win friends and influence people and suddenly, people around him may think his IQ points doubled over a weekend, but no. He is just more accessible after finetuning.\nUnlocked self-improvement has 2 folds: self-evaluation, and self-finetuning.\nThere is no magic in self-evaluation. It’s not gpt4 has gained consciousness and grow the sense of self. GPT4 is stateless. Because it has learned few more bits than gpt3.5, it simple could evaluate whatever text better by following right prompts.\nHere I want to use how OpenAI mitigates close domain hallucination with RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022) as an example to illustrate how gpt4 contributes to self-improvement with the power of RL.\nTake a look at the example of close and open hallucination.\n\n\n\n(Bubeck et al. 2023, fig. 1.8)\n\n\nOpenAI introduces a simple iterative procedure to apply gpt4 to evaluate its output and generate self correction.\n\n\n\n(“GPT-4 Technical Report” 2023, System Card, page 24)\n\n\nThe synthetic data is use to improve the mode via RLHF. (original response with hallucinations, new response without hallucination generated by gpt4) data are mixed into reward model dataset. This is RLHF\n\n\n\n(Ouyang et al. 2022, fig. 2)\n\n\nSo on high level: SFT > RM > PPO. I don’t understand why initially. Super confused.\n\nWhy RL?\nIf Flan (Chung et al. 2022) is so successful, why not just SFT gpt4 with generated hallucination free data?\nIsn’t RL sample inefficient? Cherry on the cake? Sparse feedback makes credit assignment hard, which makes learning even harder? How many unreasonably amount of trials and errors to teach a simple robot in MoJoCo to run?\n\nMy hypothesis is under the right condition, RL’s disadvantages are actually great for cooking intelligence.\n\nGood enough base intelligence.\nEnough capacity to grow and change.\n\nLet me use human learning as an unscientific example. The goal is to maximize learning, which teacher is more helpful?\n\nOne that provides extensive explanation, step by step reasoning, even hold your hand during the learning process.\nOne that only gives you binary feedback such as correct/incorrect, promising/exhausted, right direction/detour.\n\nOn the appearance, the attentive teacher seems to be the obvious choice, but I realize it depends.\nFor young Padawan, rich feedbacks and hand holding style is more effective. They need as immersive environment as possible to get over the init stage. They would really struggle with sparse, succinct feedback. Socratic method or Zen style teaching is too early.\nOn the contrary, for matured enough Jedi to become true master, he has to tackle unknown unknown and generalize mostly by himself. Breaking the frontier can’t by achieved by copy previous success. Overly involved teaching is not helpful, but obstacle that creates a ceiling for the promising Jedi. The guidance could be vague and abstract as long as the direction is good, the student could figure out the details and apply general learnings to other challenges.\nAutoregressive model with next token prediction is feedback rich learning. Every token contributes to loss, which signal for the change through back propagation. The process is super parallelizable and optimize that push all high quality text tokens on Earth through the model is doable. Text pretraining is effective intelligence bootstrapping.\nAfter pretraining and essential finetunings, gpt4-early is large enough to take further finetuning without catastrophic forgetting, and intelligent enough to accept high level feedback, aka RLHF.\nEven though synthetic data could be used for supervised finetuning, use them to improve reward model to take advantage of RL’s sparse feedback gives you the benefit of information bottleneck, a form of regularization that is even more sample efficient and generalizable. Yoda’s wise or even cryptic words may be confusing and not useful right on, but it points to problems behind a problem, which is more valuable to a smart Jedi looking backward.\nFinetuning works better on LLM. RLHF would work better on LLM as well. Small model is not intelligent enough to deal with sparse feedback, and the capacity is too small to endure series of finetuning. GPT4 crosses both the intelligence and capacity threshold to kick start the virtuous self-improvement cycle with RLHF."

    "text": "Future\n\nResearch\n\nMultimodal\nSystem 2\n\nFirstly, if gpt4 could learn a world model with useful visual representation via such limited text projection, what could be learned from multimodal projection? Visual signals are so innate to humans that some ideas we don’t even bother putting them down in texts. It’s reasonable to assume multimodal learning, if done right, would yield more powerful representation and the learning would be more sample efficient. This is the cutting edge. Even OpenAI downplays the discussion on this topic, but it begs to wonder what if it’s possible to learn a better world model with <20b params and <1T multimodal tokens?\nSecondly, the biggest limitation of gpt4 is planning. Current LLM is a stateless function. Autoregressive generation behaves like an iterative recursive process (Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman 1996, fig. 1.4), keeping states in the argument, aka context window. How to get to system 2? How could long-term memory help? Using tools? Higher level control? Moving beyond next token prediction objective?\n\n\nHuman-AI symbiosis\nFull list of risks from GPT-4 System Card (“GPT-4 Technical Report” 2023):\n\nHallucinations\nHarmful content\nHarms of representation, allocation, and quality of service\nDisinformation and influence operations\nProliferation of conventional and unconventional weapons\nPrivacy\nCybersecurity\nPotential for risky emergent behaviors\nEconomic impacts\nAcceleration\nOverreliance\n\nPowerful models introduce serious problems. Helpful and harmless are nuanced if not contradictory balance. Even honest is not so trivial. I was not familiar with the full spectrum of risks introduced in the paper because of my ignorance, I mostly focused on capability upgrade like iPhone spec bump. Definitely recommend reading the system card in full to experience the width and depth of AI dark force.\nWhat worries me the most is proliferation and acceleration. The danger of enabling simple minds with unrestricted powerful tools is obvious. Now with AI getting better and taking bigger role of evaluation and self-improvement, the speed of progress may be too fast for human to adapt. Dramatic change is in order. Social unrest is unavoidable. This is steam engine-electricity-internet level of change, even AI stops here with no further improvement.\nMore and more people are getting at the problem about what value AI should align to, who decides? These are right questions to ask. I hope the process of building ideal AI would force humans to rethink what it means to be a human? What’s the purpose? To what ends? What universal values we should get behind?\nThere would be Universal Declaration of Human Rights2 moment in the future that a group of people consciously choose a set of values as foundation of AI of the group. AI would be the most powerful creation of human civilization. I hope we could settle on a set of values that promotes peace, love and autonomy.2 https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights\nHumans need to learn how to cap the downside and exploit the upside. Alignment research is hot and still underrated. No one wants to live in a world full of super intelligent assholes, to say the least.\nFor effective collaboration, we need to know who is better at what, and allocating resource accordingly.\n\nIncremental tasks: these are tasks which can be solved in a gradual or continuous way, by adding one word or sentence at a time that constitutes progress in the direction of the solution. Those tasks can be solved via content generation which does not require any major conceptual shifts or insights, but rather relies on applying existing knowledge and skills to the given topic or problem. Examples of incremental tasks are writing a summary of a text, answering factual questions, composing a poem based on a given rhyme scheme, or solving a math problem that follows a standard procedure.\nDiscontinuous tasks: these are tasks where the content generation cannot be done in a gradual or continuous way, but instead requires a certain ”Eureka” idea that accounts for a discontinuous leap in the progress towards the solution of the task. The content generation involves discovering or inventing a new way of looking at or framing the problem, that enables the generation of the rest of the content. Examples of discontinuous tasks are solving a math problem that requires a novel or creative application of a formula, writing a joke or a riddle, coming up with a scientific hypothesis or a philosophical argument, or creating a new genre or style of writing.\n\nIt’s clear we need to identify and offload incremental work to AI. Cultivate creativity, critical thinking and intuitions that make the leap and connect seemingly irrelevant dots.\nWorking against AI is futile. Uncontrolled fear is waste of time."
