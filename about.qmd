> One pressing question woke him up every morning, as regularly as the screech of the whistle of the train that chugged by his cabin, on tracks built just up the hill from Walden Pond, where he’d hoped to still his soul. Were all these vast designs and rapid strides worth it? Thoreau thought not. He came to this truth: “They are but improved means to an unimproved end.”And still the trains chugged along, and the factories hummed, and the banks opened and closed, and the presses printed newspapers, and the telegraph wires reached across the nation, in one great and unending thrum.

I'm an independent researcher interested in cryptography and AI.

What if we didn't have to convince three people to found an organization and raise millions to do something truly meaningful and impactful? Would that increase the diversity of ideasphere?

Individuals always have absolute autonomy over the [creative arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts), though it may come at a great personal cost. One may have to live extremely frugally in exchange for autonomy, risk being canceled by mainstream social norms or even suppressed by authority. However, that hasn't stopped some stubborn spirits from creating masterpieces which still inspire people and contribute to the great conversation, our culture. How to expand the scope and reduce the cost and risk?

Combine AI and cryptography with decent personal computing power, autonomy could be affordable at scale. What would your verse be?

One billion dollar is fuck you money for the few. AI and cryptography could be fuck you power for the mass.
